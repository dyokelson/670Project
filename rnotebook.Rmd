HOW TO: (can delete this later once we get the hang of it)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### Begin Project Stuff 

The three Kaggle datasets we used are at the following URLS:
https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/data-on-covid19-coronavirus?select=owid-covid-data.csv
https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021
https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness

Load the libraries we need for the project:
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(readr)
```

Load the datasets:

```{r}
happiness_2015 <- read_csv("2015.csv")
happiness_2016 <- read_csv("2016.csv")
happiness_2017 <- read_csv("2017.csv")
happiness_2018 <- read_csv("2018.csv")
happiness_2019 <- read_csv("2019.csv")
happiness_2021 <- read_csv("world-happiness-report-2021.csv")

# covid2020 <- read_csv("owid-covid-data.csv")

# covid2020_filtered <- read_excel("Documents/2021spring/670 Data Science/project/covid2020-filtered.xlsx")
```

Start doing stuff with the data:
```{r}
show(Happiness_2017)
```
