# HappinessProject

## By Dewi Yokelson and Wencong You
Using data from 2015-2019, and 2021 (before pandemic, during/kind of after pandemic) we do some comparisons and predictions. 
We tie in some data about 2020 COVID-19 cases and deaths, etc. to draw any conclusions about how that may correlate with significantly different happiness ratings.

We use R, it's helpful data science libraries and an R-notebook (R-markdown) for the report.
